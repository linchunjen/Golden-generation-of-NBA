									<h3>Explore effects of different styles of play in the NBA</h3>

								<p>
									One of the biggest blockers in comparing NBA generations is that analysts say that
									the
									style of play is so different that it is impossible to compare players across
									multiple
									generations.
									This visualization attempts to normalize for aggressive play across generations by
									making it clear to the user the effects of aggressive play over time.

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>
							We can see from examining our different viewpoints that depending on what lens one examines
							the NBA through, one might reach a different conclusion as to which NBA generation is the
							best.
							This is the problem that has often vexed analysts and has fueled the long-running debate
							about which NBA generation is the greatest of all time.
							We started this project with the stated goal of trying to end this debate through the use of
							data and clear visualization.
							We first explored some basic statistics in basketball, namely points and success of both
							teams and players. We found that the 1980s were clearly the best generation there.
							We looked at aggressive play in basketball and how that has changed the game over time and
							found that the 1980s and the 1970s featured aggressive play that led to more points and
							assists, as well as generally more exciting play.
							We then also looked at the best NBA players and duos and found that the 1990s, followed by
							the 1980s, had the greatest players and duos available.
							Synthesizing the conclusions of these three views, <strong>it is clear to us that the
								greatest NBA
								generation is the 1980s.</strong> We hope that these visualizations and their
							associated
							findings help others resolve this debate, and we welcome any comments or feedback on our
							work or the associated results.
