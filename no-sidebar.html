							<h2>Normalizing for changes in how the game was played in the NBA over time</h2>
						</header>
						<h3>What the purpose of this visual is</h3>
						<p>
							One of the common arguments used when comparing NBA 'generations' is that it is impossible
							to accurately compare statistics across generations due to the fact that the style of play
							has changed, as well as the rules that enforce a certain style of play.
							Most commonly, expert analysts detail how basketball in earlier generations of the NBA (e.g.
							the 1980s or 1990s) was significantly more aggressive than that of the modern day (2010s)
							The goal of this view is to allow users to get an understanding of how the game of
							basketball has changed and how those changes
							This view will help the user (in part) account for differences in relevant statistics when
							comparing basketball play across generations.

						<h3>Explanation of the three charts</h3>
						<p>
							First, we give some background on these charts. There is no easy, objective way to measure
							'aggressiveness' in the NBA/
							Consequently, we looked at how we could create an 'aggression index' based on current,
							commonly-used statistics in basketball.
							We landed on using average blocks per player per game and average steals per player per game
							in order to approximate aggressivness.
							We used 'per player per game' metrics in order to mitigate differences in the lengths of
							different NBA seasons.
						</p>
						<p>
							We now examine the three separate charts <br><br>
							We first look at the bottom-left chart, which visualizes our aggression index across NBA
							seasons.
							The size of the bubble shows steals per player per game for that NBA season.
							The color of the bubble shows blocks per player per game for that NBA season. Red indicates
							a low number of blocks, yellow indivates an average number of blocks, and green indicates a
							high number of blocks.
						</p>
						<p>
							We now turn to the top-most visualization.
							We look at how average points per game (which indicate higher-scoring teams, and
							consequently more dominant and exciting basketball) correlates with our two aggression
							statistics, blocks and steals per player per game.
							At a high level, we can see that a higher number of steals and blocks generally correlates
							with a higher number of points per game
						</p>
						<p>
							We now examine our last graph, in which we compare assists per player per game against.
							At a high level, we also can see that a higher number of steals and blocks generally
							correlates with a higher number of points per game
						</p>

						<h3>Conclusions for the reader</h3>
						<p>
							We can see from the visualization here that the NBA in the late 1970s and the early 1980s
							had the most aggressive basketball.
							Consequently, when comparing play across generations, we will do our best to keep in mind
							that the rules of the NBA at that
							time that lead to more aggressive play might lead to slightly artificially inflated
							statistics.
							<br><br>
							We take the stance that a generation can be the greatest as long as it performs the best for
							the rules during it's time. Aggressive play resulting in better statistics actually likely
							lends credence to a particular generation being better than another.
							Consequently, while we will take into account the effects of the differences in the game at
							the time, we believe that the results of this visual actually make the 1970s and the 1980s
							seem to be the best NBA generations.
